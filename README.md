# CSG - Color Scheme Generator
KDE Plasma color scheme generator script.

## How to use
- First we need to make the script executable. We can do it with `chmod +x csg`
- Then, we can just execute it with `./csg` and follow the steps from terminal

Be sure that you have **KColorChooser** and **Python 3** installed!

## Examples

Here you can see some generated colors example.
All the colors are generated with a normal style and with an alternative style, with darker headers.

## Credits
I'd like to create this section to thank [@siggsy](https://github.com/siggsy), creator of [TKP - Titlebar Kolor Picker](https://github.com/siggsy/Tkp).

I start creating a Python version of TKP script then, based in TKP script, this CSG script.
