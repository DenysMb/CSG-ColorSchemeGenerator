# CSG - Color Scheme Generator
KDE Plasma color scheme generator script.

## How to use
- First we need to make the script executable. We can do it with `chmod +x csg`
- Then, we can just execute it with `./csg` and follow the steps from terminal
- Now you can select the generated color from KDE **System Settings**!

Be sure that you have **KColorChooser** and **Python 3** installed!

## Check too
You can check too my others two scripts:
- [WCG - Wallpaper Color Scheme Generator](https://github.com/DenysMb/WCG-WallpaperColorSchemeGenerator): With this script you can automatically generate A color-scheme based on your wallpaper.
- [TKP - Tile Color Picker](https://github.com/DenysMb/TKP-TileColorPicker): With this script you can set the header/tile color of a window to match with their main window color. This is a Python version of the [TKP script](https://github.com/siggsy/Tkp) from [@siggsy](https://github.com/siggsy).

## Examples

Here you can see some generated colors example.
All the colors are generated with a normal style and with an alternative style, with darker headers.
